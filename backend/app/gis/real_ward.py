"""Real-ward data provider: ingests an actual pilot ward via OpenStreetMap
(roads + waterways, through osmnx/Overpass) and a DEM tile.

Requires REAL_WARD_BBOX="min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat". The DEM is
fetched automatically on first use from AWS's public, keyless "terrarium"
elevation tiles (see terrain_tiles.py) -- no manual download needed. A
higher-resolution SRTM tile from USGS EarthExplorer (scripts/download_srtm.py)
can be dropped at the same path instead if you have one; this provider
doesn't care which source produced the GeoTIFF at self.dem_path.

Satisfies the same WardDataProvider interface as SyntheticWardProvider, so
the rest of the pipeline (hydrology -> drainage graph -> GNN -> routing)
needs zero changes to consume real data. The one seam that's genuinely
different from the synthetic path: every road-graph node here needs a
(grid_row, grid_col) pair locating it within the DEM raster, computed via
the DEM's affine transform, so downstream elevation sampling and catchment
assignment (written against a rectangular grid) work unmodified.
